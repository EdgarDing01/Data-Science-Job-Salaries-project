# Overview

**Background**

This dataset contains **job salary records for Data Science roles worldwide**, covering multiple years and diverse working arrangements.
It provides information on **job titles, experience levels, employment types, company sizes, locations, remote work ratios**, and most importantly, **standardized salaries (in USD)**.

Given the global demand for data professionals, this dataset is valuable for **analyzing salary trends**, **understanding factors that drive compensation**, and **supporting career or HR planning decisions**.

**Goal of the Project**

Build a machine learning model to:

* **Predict salary (USD)** based on job, experience, and company attributes
* Identify **key drivers of compensation** (experience, company size, remote ratio, etc.)
* Provide insights for **job seekers and employers** to make data-driven career and hiring decisions

**Files Provided**

* `ds_salaries.csv`: Main dataset containing job-related attributes and salary information.

**Project Objective**

The goal of this notebook is to **model and predict data science salaries**, helping to:

* Benchmark salaries across roles, levels, and geographies
* Explore the effect of remote work and company size on pay
* Support fair compensation strategies in the job market
* Provide insights for career planning and HR analytics

**Key Steps**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** <br>
  Study salary distribution by job title, location, company size, remote ratio, and experience level.

* **Feature Engineering:**
  Encode categorical variables, normalize salaries, and create derived features (e.g., region grouping).

* **Modeling:**
  Train and compare multiple models:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regressor
  * XGBoost / LightGBM
  * Ensemble approaches

* **Evaluation Framework:**
  Use cross-validation and evaluate with:

  * RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)
